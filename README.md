# RecursionError in Python Factorial Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions: the RecursionError.  The `factorial.py` file contains a recursive factorial function that works correctly for non-negative integers but throws a RecursionError for negative inputs. The solution is provided in `factorialSolution.py` and handles this edge case.
